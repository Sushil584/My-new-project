# Career Growth

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project will use database to provide assistance in bringing further career growth for all employees or individuals who seek for it.


## Background

It should solve an issue of hunting numerous websites and travelling to gather information about what is actually available in their path to grow. This issue is really common as myself an employee is struggling to find enough information based on current market conditions and demands.This topic is important as we know most of us wants to achieve new heights in thier carrer but what is next is always a question for lot of us.This project will open new source of information based on their acheived skill sets and already gained education.


## How is it used?

This AI modle will evaluate individual current skills ,education and experience then propose needed additional requirements (like TAFE,degree,experience etc) 
to achieve new opportunities available which would be very help for carrer development.
This AI model should be able to successfully create and describe a plan for an individual who in sesrch for further carrer growth. Also the Users who willing to work internationally should be able to retrieve their pre-requisites or requirements before entering into the overseas market.


## Data sources and AI methods
Main source of the data is from within the workplace discussions where most of us are keen to upgrade ourselves which may bring Job satisfaction later. AI methods should be able to throw some light on an individual shortcomings in regards to carrer.


## Challenges

This project may not fulfil expected financial growth for an individual through proposed career growth because ultimately it depends on an employer or industry where they always seeks more worth it for the money they pay. It doesn't guarantee a growth where individual capabilities may fall short to achieve. Therefore before all every user have to calculate those risks involved like time and money against proposed AI generated plan to get those additional requirements.


## What next?


Project could grow when industries feed their employee skill requirements data to this AI model which would help reduce future skill shortages as personal already ready as required.
Job seeking database sources would be a good feed as well. Include information from Universities or institutions to simplify this process by modifying their courses accordingly.
This project may turn into a social network kind as well where every users have thier own profile ready to communicate with others while following thier path growth.
AI model should monitor every communication in case false or highly unlikely information floating around.
